# CsharpDiceGame
My first C# program, to get a feel for the language. Might not be written in the "proper way" but at least it runs, so that's cool. :) :v:

### 
It's a simple console dice game. 
* Input: Amount of rolls(Int between 1-4)
* Rolling a 1 grants a double roll
* Output: Summary of rolls
